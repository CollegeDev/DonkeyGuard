I developed DonkeyGuard from scratch with all my experience I've made with PDroid. DonkeyGuard allows you a fine-grained tuning of access to your private data. It currently supports 41 restrictions which can be applied for every application. Specifically, it is a Privacy service provider which implements a set of modifications to the Android Framework to allow you to interact with applications which are trying to access your private data.\r\n\r\n## Supported Features\r\nDonkeyGuard allows blocking access for any installed application on your phone to the following data separately:\r\n* device_id\r\n* phone_number\r\n* sim_serial_number\r\n* subscriber_id\r\n* incoming_call_number\r\n* outgoing_call_number\r\n* gps_and_network_location\r\n* impi_impu\r\n* cell_info\r\n* accounts\r\n* accounts_credentials\r\n* read_contacts\r\n* read_call_log\r\n* call_phone\r\n* read_calendar\r\n* receive_sms\r\n* send_sms\r\n* receive_mms\r\n* send_mms - not implemented in alpha\r\n* record_audio\r\n* use_camera\r\n* read_bookmarks\r\n* wifi_info\r\n* switch_mobile_network_state\r\n* switch_wifi_state\r\n* sim_info\r\n* network_info\r\n* android_id\r\n* access_media\r\n* read_external_storage - not implemented in alpha\r\n* write_calendar\r\n* write_call_log\r\n* write_contacts\r\n* write_bookmarks\r\n* write_external_storage - not implemented in alpha\r\n* account_authenticator\r\n* read_sms\r\n* write_sms\r\n* read_mms\r\n* write_mms\r\n* network_state\r\n\r\n## Installation Instructions\r\n1. Download the application (category releases)\r\n2. Install it\r\n3. Activate the application inside the XPosedFramework\r\n4. Reboot your device\r\n5. Now you can use DonkeyGuard\r\n\r\n## Translation\r\nIf you want to translate the application, please visit [GetLocalization](http://www.getlocalization.com/DonkeyGuard/). I will sync these files every release.\r\n\r\n## How can I report Bugs or feature requests?\r\nSimply use the features of github to report bugs or request new features.\r\n\r\n## FAQ\r\n### My device doesn't boot any more, what can I do?\r\nDeactivate the Xposed-Framework during the boot (press volume up/down several times). If that won't work for you, please flash the RescueDonkey.zip from this repo (branch rescue). This *.zip will normally be copied at the first start of the application to your default sdcard directory.\r\n\r\n## Feature Descriptions\r\n### Deny Modes\r\nIn the preferences you can find two options: \r\n* Softcoded Default Deny Mode\r\n* Hardcoded Default Deny Mode\r\n\r\nBoth of the \"settings\" are melt together with the architecture of the application. The modes protect you against IPC failures or database error during the request of personal data from an application. To understand how it works, just take a look at the figure below (sequence diagram; This diagram is not designed for software architectures, it is as simple as possible).\r\n\r\n![Test](http://www.bilderload.com/bild/349154/denymoderedcircleAJ3VY.png)\r\n\r\nThe diagram shows the sequence of the access to private data on your phone. The call of the method where the application normally gets the private data from will be forwarded to the **SettingsServer**. The server identifies the process with the assistance of the kernel and asks the **DatabaseManager** to get the user defined settings for the calling process. The Manager fetches the data (if needed) from the database and returns it to the **SettingsServer**. If something went wrong with the communication between the **SettingsServer**, **DatabaseManager** or **Database** (red circle on the right; e.g. due to a broken database), the **SettingsServer** doesn't know if the application is allowed to access your private data or not. For this reason the Softcoded Default Deny mode will trigger and decide whether the application will get:\r\n\r\n* The real data (allow)\r\n* Fake randomized data (random)\r\n* Empty data (empty)\r\n\r\nYou can choose this behavior inside the preference fragment. If the Softcoded Default Deny mode or the IPC with the **SettingsServer** fails, the Hardcoded Default Deny Mode will trigger. This mode is \"hardcoded\" and can't be bypassed. It has the same behavior like the Softcoded Default Deny mode, but can not be modified by the user. In future I will provide 3 versions of the application where the Hardcoded Default Deny mode has following values:\r\n\r\n* Real (allow)\r\n* Random (randomized generated fake data)\r\n* Empty (empty values)\r\n\r\nSo you have to decide which behavior you prefer and download the suitable version.\r\n\r\n### Default Privacy Mode\r\nThe default privacy mode is a framework feature which gives you the possibility to decide what happens if an application tries to access your private data, but no settings for the requested application have been set. The feature supports following values:\r\n\r\n* Allow - The application will get access to the requested permission/data)\r\n* Random - The application will get randomized generated fake data\r\n* Empty - The application will get empty values\r\n\r\nIt is not recommended to use Random or Empty, because it could be that system applications won't work as excepted anymore.\r\n\r\n## Preview\r\n![](http://www.bilderload.com/bild/348344/screenshot20140729093144UO8BJ.png)\r\n![](http://www.bilderload.com/bild/348345/screenshot20140729093210D9G30.png)  ![](http://www.bilderload.com/bild/348346/screenshot20140729093216GY28T.png)  ![](http://www.bilderload.com/bild/348347/screenshot201407290932276TD10.png)   ![](http://www.bilderload.com/bild/348348/screenshot20140729093258VVWU5.png)  ![](http://www.bilderload.com/bild/348349/screenshot20140729093310VT431.png)  ![](http://www.bilderload.com/bild/348350/screenshot201407290933225VFFJ.png) ","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
