						Deny Modes
					</h3>
					<p>In the preferences you can find two options: </p>
					<ul>
						<li>Softcoded Default Deny Mode</li>
						<li>Hardcoded Default Deny Mode</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						Both of the "settings" are melt together with the architecture of the application.
						The modes protect you against IPC failures or database error during the request of personal data from an application.
						To understand how it works, just take a look at the figure below (sequence diagram; This diagram is not designed for software architectures, it is as simple as possible).
					</p>
					<p>
						<img src="http://www.bilderload.com/bild/349154/denymoderedcircleAJ3VY.png" alt="Test">
					</p>
					<p>
						The diagram shows the sequence of the access to private data on your phone. 
						The call of the method where the application normally gets the private data from will be forwarded to the <strong>SettingsServer</strong>. 
						The server identifies the process with the assistance of the kernel and asks the <strong>DatabaseManager</strong> to get the user defined settings for the calling process. 
						The Manager fetches the data (if needed) from the database and returns it to the <strong>SettingsServer</strong>. 
						If something went wrong with the communication between the <strong>SettingsServer</strong>, <strong>DatabaseManager</strong> or <strong>Database</strong> (red circle on the right; e.g. due to a broken database), 
						the <strong>SettingsServer</strong> doesn't know if the application is allowed to access your private data or not. 
						For this reason the Softcoded Default Deny mode will trigger and decide whether the application will get:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>The real data (allow)</li>
						<li>Fake randomized data (random)</li>
						<li>Empty data (empty)</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						You can choose this behavior inside the preference fragment. 
						If the Softcoded Default Deny mode or the IPC with the <strong>SettingsServer</strong> fails, the Hardcoded Default Deny Mode will trigger. 
						This mode is "hardcoded" and can't be bypassed. It has the same behavior like the Softcoded Default Deny mode, but can not be modified by the user. 
						In future I will provide 3 versions of the application where the Hardcoded Default Deny mode has following values:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Real (allow)</li>
						<li>Random (randomized generated fake data)</li>
						<li>Empty (empty values)</li>
					</ul>
					<p>So you have to decide which behavior you prefer and download the suitable version.</p>

						Default Privacy Mode
					</h3>
					<p>
						The default privacy mode is a framework feature which gives you the possibility to decide what happens if an application tries to access your private data, but no settings for the requested application have been set. 
						The feature supports following values:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Allow - The application will get access to the requested permission/data)</li>
						<li>Random - The application will get randomized generated fake data</li>
						<li>Empty - The application will get empty values</li>
					</ul>
					<p>It is not recommended to use Random or Empty, because it could be that system applications won't work as expected anymore.</p>
